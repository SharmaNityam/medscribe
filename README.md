## 🌐 Backend

### Deployment URL
**Backend URL:** `https://ai-scribe-copilot-rev9.onrender.com`

### ⚠️ Backend Limitations

**Important:** The backend is currently deployed on Render's free tier, which has the following limitations:

- **In-Memory Storage**: The backend uses in-memory storage (JavaScript `Map` objects), meaning all data is lost when the server restarts.
- **Automatic Sleep**: Render's free tier automatically puts servers to sleep after ~15 minutes of inactivity.
- **Data Loss on Restart**: When the server wakes up or restarts, all sessions, patients, and chunks stored in memory are cleared.
- **Session Recovery**: The Flutter app includes automatic session recovery logic that recreates lost sessions when the backend restarts.
